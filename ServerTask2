Imagine a server with the following specs:

● 4 times Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4830 v4 @ 2.00GHz
● 64GB of ram
● 2 tb HDD disk space
● 2 x 10Gbit/s nics

The server is used for SSL offloading and proxies around 25000 requests per second.
Please let us know which metrics are interesting to monitor in that specific case and
how would you do that? What are the challenges of monitoring this?

Based in the specs we are like using 14 cores and the 2TB is a bit low for proxies around 25000 requests per second that might cause slow process of offloading which that can be a challenge on this offloading. Furthermore, I can say we can utilized SSL termination device to encrypt traffic ensures that our security devices can focus on the work that built this to do. It can also manage many connections at one time, while simplify the complexity and eliminating performance degradation.
